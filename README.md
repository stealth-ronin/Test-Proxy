# Proxy Cage
[Evervault](https://evervault.com) makes it easy to encrypt data at source, process it in a Cage — a secure, serverless function — and never store it unencrypted.

This Cage creates a simple proxy that allows you to send requests to third-party APIs without ever having to store or handle sensitive data.
